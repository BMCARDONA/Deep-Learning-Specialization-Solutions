#### Here's what you should remember:
- Data synthesis is an effective way to create a large training set for speech problems, specifically trigger word detection. 
- Using a spectrogram and optionally a 1D conv layer is a common pre-processing step prior to passing audio data to an RNN, GRU or LSTM.
- An end-to-end deep learning approach can be used to build a very effective trigger word detection system.
