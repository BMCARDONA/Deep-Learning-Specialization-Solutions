# GRADED FUNCTION: identity_block

def identity_block(X, f, filters, training=True, initializer=random_uniform):
    """
    Implementation of the identity block as defined in Figure 4
    
    Arguments:
    X -- input tensor of shape (m, n_H_prev, n_W_prev, n_C_prev)
    f -- integer, specifying the shape of the middle CONV's window for the main path
    filters -- python list of integers, defining the number of filters in the CONV layers of the main path
    training -- True: Behave in training mode
                False: Behave in inference mode
    initializer -- to set up the initial weights of a layer. Equals to random uniform initializer
    
    Returns:
    X -- output of the identity block, tensor of shape (m, n_H, n_W, n_C)
