**What you should remember**: 

* Semantic image segmentation predicts a label for every single pixel in an image
* U-Net uses an equal number of convolutional blocks and transposed convolutions for downsampling and upsampling, respectively. 
* Skip connections are used to prevent border pixel information loss and overfitting in U-Net
